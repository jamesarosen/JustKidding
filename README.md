## Contributing ##

For bug reports, open an
[issue](https://github.com/jamesarosen/JustKidding/issues) on GitHub.

JustKidding has a ‘commit-bit’ policy, much like the Rubinius project
and Gemcutter. Submit a patch that is accepted, and you can get full
commit access to the project. All you have to do is open an issue
asking for access and I'll add you as a collaborator.
Feel free to fork the project though and have fun in your own sandbox.

Code style:

 * 2 space indent
 * all conditional and loop blocks have `{ }`
 * not picky about spaces around arguments
 * all code must pass JSLint with fairly strict settings
